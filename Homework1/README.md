#Inter Process Synhronization

In this assignment you are expected to simulate and solve “DEU Dolmuş Taxi” synchronization problem, which its details are given. 

On your days at the university, you are waiting for a long time at the entrance of the campus to reach the department or library almost every time. We are launching the DEU Dolmuş Taxi application to facilitate this. This will prevent both all students to create long queues and to move the taxis before be full. Also it will provide a safe and comfortable transportation because taxis will carry students up to the capacity. 

With your simulation and solution with mutex and semaphores students and taxis hopefully will no longer wait so long for their courses.

You have total 100 students. Initially, you suppose that all taxis are empty at stop.
